GradEdIn is a platform that connects people to academic opportunities. 
It works by giving users - seekers and employees -
 the opportunity to create profiles with necessary 
details, seekers' profile with cv and cover letter 
which is then used to apply in one click to opportunities posted by 
employers, and also with the option to submit a tailored resume for an opportunity.
